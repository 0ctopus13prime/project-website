[Zeta Alpha](https://www.zeta-alpha.com/) is inviting the OpenSearch community in Amsterdam to join the launch event of the Amsterdam User Group. We start at 18:00, we'll have Pizza, Refreshments, Talks, and Networking (this is an in-person only event).

**What our group is about:**

We are a group of people in the Amsterdam area with keen interest in search engineering, open-source search technology, and search relevancy. If you've utilized or are simply curious about core search technologies like OpenSearch, Lucene, or Solr, and their application in fields such as enterprise search, vector search, and generative AI, this is the space for you!

We embrace all skill levels. Even if search is just a small part of your day-to-day duties, come learn and connect with other smart engineers. We cover and welcome talks on topics including: search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for Large Language Models (LLM), data connectors and data visualization.

**Time and location:**

November 10th, 2023 from 18:00 to 19:30. Room L3.36 at Lab 42, Science Park 900, Amsterdam.
