### What is OpenSearchCon?

OpenSearchCon is the annual conference that brings the community together to learn, connect, and collaborate. This year, we expand our popular user conference beyond North America with the addition of events in [Europe](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/europe/index.html) and [India](https://opensearch.org/events/opensearchcon/2024/india/index.html). OpenSearchCon aims to educate and inspire with presented sessions, participant-driven meetings, and exhibits and demonstrations from OpenSearch Project partners. Users, administrators, and developers come to OpenSearchCon to explore solutions to real-world problems, network with their peers, and take a look into the future of search, analytics, and observability applications.

With this being our third consecutive event in North America, we have watched this event grow from its humble beginnings as a single-track, one-day event, into a three-day, multi-track open source community experience that includes an unconference, training and workshops, a partner round table, and other exciting networking and partner events.

We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco!
