excerpt: "Celebrating of the release of Data Prepper 1.2.1, we are adding a suite of open-source performance tests for everyone to measure performance and tune configurations for maximum log ingestion throughput. Our goals in building a performance test suite are to create simulations of real-world scenarios used in any environment while maintaining compatibility with popular log ingestion applications."

Following the launch of log pipeline in [Data Prepper 1.2](https://www.opensearch.org/blog/technical-post/2021/12/Introducing-Data-Prepper-1.2.0-with-Log-Pipelines/), we are excited to share the results of our performance testing suite. Our goal is to create a tool that can simulate a set of real-world scenarios in any environment while maintaining compatibility with popular log ingestion applications. In all performance test results discussed below, the test environments and configurations are identical, except where the same option is not available for all applications. See testing limitations section for additional details.

# TL;DR Data Prepper 1.2.1 vs Logstash 7.13.2 Results
- Data Prepper 1.2.1 has 88% better sustained throughput than Logstash 7.13.2
- Data Prepper 1.2.1 has 46% lower mean response latency than Logstash 7.13.2. Response latency here is, the amount of time it takes from when a request is made by the client to the time it takes for Data Prepper’s or Logstash’s response to get back to that client.

Throughout the test, Data Prepper can consistently maintain a higher throughput.

Logstash hit peak latency of 7382ms
Data Prepper’s peak latency was 5276ms

|:-------------------------------------------|-------------------:|----------------:|
| Throughput                                 |           728 MB/s |        387 MB/s |

Data Prepper 1.2.1 processed 88% more logs than Logstash 7.13.2 within the 30-minute test limit.

# Performance testing setup

## Data Prepper Environment

## Logstash Environment

![Logstash Environment](/assets/media/blog-images/2022-01-24-data-prepper-1.2.1-performance-testing/Logstash.png){: .img-fluid}

Let’s compare the performance of the latest release of Data Prepper 1.2.1 against Logstash 7.13.2. We configured 10 clients to send requests as frequently as possible. Each request was 19.2 KB and contained a batch of 200 logs. We then ran this test for 30 minutes and measured the latency and throughput.

## Application Configurations

| Property             | Data Prepper | Logstash |
| -------------------- | -----------: | -------: |
| HTTP Source Thread   |            4 |        4 |
| Max Connection Count |        2,000 |    n/a * |
| Request Timeout      |       10,000 |    n/a * |
| Buffer Size          |    2,000,000 |    n/a * |
| Batch Size           |        5,000 |    5,000 |
| Worker Thread        |           12 |       12 |
| SSL                  |     Disabled | Disabled |

_[*] Note, Max Connection Count, Request Timeout, Buffer Size are not configurable with Logstash 7.13.2_

## Data Prepper Scaling

In this simulation we ramp up from 1 client to 60 over one hour to measure the impact concurrent clients have on performance.

As the number of clients increases Data Preppers throughput remains constant, processing an average of 10,473 MB/m.

# Limitation of Testing

It’s important to note that Data Prepper 1.2.1 and Logstash 7.13.2 support different feature sets, and our performance test suite is targeted at common functionality. As Data Prepper adds more processors and sources, we will expand our to cover those use cases, and we will continue update the community with performance benchmarks.

## Candidates for future performance testing scenarios and improvements

![Environment Reference](/assets/media/blog-images/2022-01-24-data-prepper-1.2.1-performance-testing/Environment-Reference.png){: .img-fluid}

In a real-world deployment, if Data Prepper is unable to keep pace with the logs generated by the source application. Data Prepper will become a bottleneck causing backpressure on the source application. In the future we will enhance our performance tests to simulate backpressure and measure the impact.

The scope of our initial performance testing scenarios was focused on a common scenario, http source, grok processor, and an OpenSearch sink. As new features are added to Data Prepper in upcoming releases, we plan to add matching performance testing simulations for core functionality.

# Running Data Prepper Performance tests
Performance suite source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/sbayer55/gatling-tests/). To run the full test suite execute `./gradlew –rerun-tasks gatlingRun -Dhost=<target url>`. After all tests have completed HTML reports will be created in `./build/reports/gatling/<simulation-name>-<unix-timestamp>/index.html`. Further instructions on running performance tests and Gatling are available in the repository [readme](https://github.com/sbayer55/gatling-tests/blob/main/README.md).

For more information on Gatling checkout their [website](https://gatling.io/).
