In a far away land, where search experts meet to discussion the art state of the most wonderful search engine of all: OpenSearch. A tool that does not belong to the royals, but to everyone, and everyone can help to use it and build it. It’s time to talk about the OpenSearchCon North America 2024.

The event happened in San Francisco, in the United States. The city, being the heart of innovation, felt like the ideal place to talk about such important topics like Search and Machine Learning. The conference took place from September 24 to 26, 2024 and covered not only talks, but also training and the Unconference (yes, we’ll explain that part in a moment!).

## Keynote 🎤📢⭐

There is no present without a past, and that is what the keynote by Eli Fischer highlighted about the OpenSearch’s history. He showed how contributions shape such a complex project, working to keep it stable and shinning. 

Continuing with Anupam Chaturvedi talking about Generative AI and OpenSearch interacting with predominantly technologies like information stored in PDF. This reminds us that new technologies have to consider also, the past ones. But how do ensure the future of OpenSearch?

OpenSearch is open source, and we all know that modern technology wouldn’t exist without open source software. From a long-term perspective, around OpenSearch and other open source projects, we need flexibility and neutrality. The Linux Foundation, as a non-profit organization, supports the sustainable growth of the OpenSearch project in this way. Jim Zemlin, the executive director of the Linux Foundation, shared how this works in practice. 

Overall, we learned about the past, present, and future of OpenSearch in one inspiring keynote presentation.

While conference formats are nice, sometimes what you really need is an Unconference. Time to explain what actually happened there.

## Unconference 💡🗣️🌟

The fun of the Unconference lies in its format: anyone can propose a topic, participants vote, and the most popular topics are presented which leads to thoughtful conversations in this open idea-sharing approach. You can call it an organized chaos full of interesting discussions and learnings about the search world! 

Some of our favorite Unconference topics were: 
- [Michael Froh: OpenSearch is a database?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFItXRGumq8)
- [Scott Stults & Eric Pugh: Lessons in Rebooting a Plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_dc8l2P1ew)

## Trainings 🎉🍹🎶
Have you ever looked for a great opportunity to learn OpenSearch from industry experts? On the third day of the conference, this became a reality. Attendees could dive into relevance engineering with OpenSearch, learning how to measure search quality and improve it by adjusting field weights. Additionally, those interested in deploying OpenSearch on Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) had the chance to work alongside Jon Handler and Arun Lakshmanan in hands-on labs covering OpenSearch, EKS, and data management. These sessions provided immediate, practical experience with OpenSearch, making them invaluable for participants
