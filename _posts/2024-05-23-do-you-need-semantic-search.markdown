I get ask this question all the time. Do I need semantic search? It's a good question but it's not the right question to start with. We need to first understand what semantic search does for us. Then we can dive into whether or not it's a good fit for your use case.

I've answered both questions in my [most recent blog](https://tippybits.com/should-you-be-doing-vector-search/) and its video counterpart linked below. These answer the following questions: 

1. How does OpenSearch find documents out of the box?
2. Why these traditional search methods don't always work. 
3. When and how to use semantic search in OpenSearch. 

To help I created some additional resources to help you get started! [This GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/dtaivpp/c587d99a2cab441eba0314534ae87c86) will help you create an OpenSearch docker compose environment. Also, I have created [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/dtaivpp/d7e8d8a3ee5debaf896ed2f45b915ad3) with all the code needed to create your own semantic search pipeline right from OpenSearch Dashboards. I hope you enjoy them and if your company needs help getting started with semantic search they can reach out to me [on my website](https://tippybits.com/services)!
