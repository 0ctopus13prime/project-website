We are pleased to announce the launch of  [Nightly Playgrounds](https://playground.nightly.opensearch.org/). This environment provides a dynamic preview of your work within a fully deployed distribution cluster for the upcoming versions of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. As the name suggest, this live demo environment hosts clusters deployed using the latest successful and validated nightly build artifacts of both OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. The [OpenSearch](https://build.ci.opensearch.org/view/Build/job/distribution-build-opensearch/) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://build.ci.opensearch.org/view/Build/job/distribution-build-opensearch-dashboards/) distributions are built daily that includes actively developed features for upcoming 2.x and 3.x version.

The primary motivation of this project is to facilitate experimentation with new and forthcoming features, gather early feedback and allow users to witness enhancements in real-time as they are integrated into the distribution. 


### What can you do in Nightly Playground environment?

Similar to current [playground](https://playground.opensearch.org/app/home), every user has anonymous, read-only access, allowing you to try new features and explore preconfigured sample data. 

* **Early access to actively built new features
    **You can interact with sample dashboards, data visualizations, and data sources without installing and configuring OpenSearch or OpenSearch Dashboards in your own environment. Get early access to the new actively built features overnight and provide feedback improvements based on it.
* **Faster and easier debugging**
    During the 2.16.0 release, the alerting dashboards plugin successfully detected an issue using nightly playgrounds clusters, saving valuable time on setup and debugging. These clusters can also be utilized for everyday debugging and during time-sensitive events, such as releases.
* **Help with documentation**
    The technical writers at OpenSearch often need to verify the technical aspect of the documentation submitted to the [project-website](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/), which covers upcoming features, enhancements, and bug fixes. . Recently, we improved the permissions to the nightly playgrounds by integrating GitHub as an OIDC, granting enhanced permissions to the documentation team. This change simplifies their process, saving time for both technical writers and developers by eliminating the need to set up dedicated clusters for verification, ultimately making the entire process more efficient.


### High Level Architecture Diagram:

Nightly playground environments are provisioned utilizing daily-built x64 Linux tarballs of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards on AWS EC2 instances, orchestrated through the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The deployment process is facilitated by GitHub Actions, ensuring seamless integration with cloud infrastructure. In addition to the default configurations, the security settings have been meticulously tailored to enable GitHub as an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. The nightly playgrounds use [opensearch-cluster-cdk](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-cluster-cdk) as the upstream dependency to deploy the highly customizable cluster.

### Frequently Asked Questions

* **Where can we access the nightly playgrounds?**
    Nightly playgrounds can be accessed at https://playground.nightly.opensearch.org/. You can select the version you wish to explore, with current support for the upcoming 2.x and 3.x releases.



* **Which commit was used to build this distribution that is currently deployed?**
    Every user by default has the read-only access to these clusters. The entire distribution manifest containing details such as component name, repository, GitHub reference and commit_id is indexed in the cluster as a part of the automation. Simply go to the `dev-tools` and run the below query:
    
    For OpenSearch componentsâ€™ details:

```
  GET opensearch/_doc/1
```

For OpenSearch Dashboards components' details:

```
  GET opensearch-dashboards/_doc/1
```

This will give you components present in the deployed cluster along with the commit_id and the artifact location.

* **Why are certain components/plugins missing from the cluster/distribution?**
    If a component is absent from the distribution, it indicates that it failed to build during the distribution process. However, the nightly builds will continue even if a component encounters an error. This ensures that the overall build process remains unaffected by individual component failures, allowing for uninterrupted progress. Please visit the corresponding component repository and search for build failure autocut issues. Example: https://github.com/opensearch-project/security-analytics/issues/904
    
* **What if we need more data indexed into these cluster?**
    Please feel free to create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-devops/issues) or pull request with the required data that you need in these clusters. The maintainers will review the data for security and sensitive information and help it index into the cluster.



* **What if we need more permissions to test different features on these clusters?**
    We recently integrated nightly playgrounds with GitHub as an OIDC. As of now, all logged in users have read-only access to the cluster. We plan to enhance these permissions using the GitHub handles in future. Please create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-devops/issues) to request required permissions along with your GitHub handle.
    

### Wrapping it up!

We continue to make more enhancements to these [nightly playgrounds](https://playground.nightly.opensearch.org/) with an intention to make them more useful for the community and the developers revealing the new features as soon as they are built. 
Check out the reproducible infrastructure as a code in [GitHub](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-devops/tree/main/nightly-playground). More details can be found in the meta [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-devops/issues/129).
Please feel free to provide us feedback, request features and contribute to make nightly playgrounds more usable.
