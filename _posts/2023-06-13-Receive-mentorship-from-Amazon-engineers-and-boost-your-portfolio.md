On March 1, 2023, the OpenSearch Project launched the College Contributor Initiative (CCI), a 12-week pilot program that provided 3rd- and 4th-year undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to build their open-source portfolio and acquire industry-level software development experience. The program aimed to significantly expand our project community and capacity. The pilot program successfully concluded on May 31st, and its outsized impact, detailed below, has led us to commit to expanding the program to new geographic locales and all types of external contributors.

## Jump-starting the flywheel

One of the driving factors for Amazon to open-source OpenSearch, instead of forking it and licensing it under proprietary terms, was to enable community contributions and accelerate development without the need for additional hiring. To foster the growth of our open-source ecosystem, the project launched the College Contributor Initiative. This initiative provides participating repositories with unique access to Amazon engineers who act as mentors. To pilot the program, we sought and obtained legal and business approval to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Kazakhstan in February 2023, involving students from 15 universities.
Prior to the CCI program, **6%** of contributions came from external contributors **in February 2023**. **After just two months** of the program, we have already seen a significant increase, with **21%** of contributions now coming from external sources on a weekly basis. This increase signifies a boost in development velocity. When comparing the two months prior to CCI with the two months of CCI operation, we observed 518 contributions compared to 183 contributions from the prior period. It is worth noting **the significant impact of CCI on the distribution of Pull Requests** (PRs) among the various opensearch-project repositories. Previously, the OpenSearch core repository alone accounted for 17% of all external contributions and **was the only repository** with more than 20 PRs raised (with the next closest repository accounting for just 8% or less). **Now**, with CCI contributions, **we have 10 other repositories** with over 20 contributions in the same two-month time frame, with **CCI accounting for 42% of those contributions**. For smaller repositories such as the Python client, CCI has **doubled** the number of external contributions.

The CCI benefits both the OpenSearch Project and the new contributors. The program helps increase community participation and overcome resource limitations while providing students with valuable experience in software development and networking opportunities with experienced engineers. By creating a welcoming and supportive environment for new contributors, the OpenSearch Project cultivates a flywheel effect, driving increased community participation.

## Amazon’s investment

To support the CCI's pilot phase, 17 AWS engineers from seven participating teams volunteered to be mentors. These mentors establish personal connections and are dedicated to helping contributors succeed in their contributions. They actively create beginner-friendly tasks, promptly review student code, and address student questions. Additionally, the program organizes weekly office hours to offer an alternative avenue for addressing common questions and providing project context. This enables contributors to network and receive expert guidance and personalized feedback from experienced engineers, helping them solve real-world problems. Furthermore, the program offers insights into software development beyond coding, including research, code review, testing, and writing. As we move forward, the program will expand both the number of repository mentors and the number of supported participating repositories, catering to the diverse interests of a wide range of external contributors.


## Students and schools love the idea

Although our initial target for the first pilot was to include 100 students, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, resulting in extending invitations to **over 400 students**. The popularity of the program can be attributed, in part, to the opportunity it offers to contribute to widely used open-source software projects, allowing contributors to showcase their work in portfolios and resumes. We are continuously brainstorming new ways to recognize these contributions, such as mentioning and expressing gratitude in release notes. Contributors have also expressed their appreciation for the chance to interact with, learn from, and have discussions with Amazon engineers. While most of the office hours sessions focus on addressing specific issues and pull requests, they have also covered professional development topics. These discussions have touched upon what it's like to work at Amazon and how the software development career may be influenced by recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).

## Check out the impact of the program (so far)

1. **Streamlined and improved developer onboarding.** The CCI gave the project teams an incentive to prioritize contributor onboarding improvements that serve both new team members and external contributors. Direct interactions with contributors helped identify the remaining gaps, and the contributors themselves filled those in with better documentation and tooling. We also found that, by making contributing to the project easier, we attracted other contributions. For example, a student created a [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/3759) for other contributors about the setup process for OpenSearch Dashboards, which another student added to the [developer guide](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/3764). As a result, in v2.6.0 of OpenSearch Dashboards, 10% of merged PRs were from first-time contributors. _In v2.7.0, after starting the program,_ **_29%_** _of merged PRs were from first-time contributors_, with nearly a third of these from non-program participants.
2. **Improved code quality and developer experience.** Contributors took an active interest in suggesting improvements to our tech stack and CI processes instead of waiting to be handed tasks. In six weeks, **program participants opened 277 GitHub issues**. They’ve _discovered and fixed bugs (for example, a student raised an_ [_issue_](https://github.com/opensearch-project/oui/issues/699) _with our data grid component in the OpenSearch user interface [OUI] and is working on its fix), and implemented improvements that were not planned or even in the project backlog (for example, a student_ [_updated the OUI’s deprecated webpack configurations_](https://github.com/opensearch-project/oui/pull/578)). Some contributors were eager to pick up more challenging issues beyond typical good first issues (for example, some major REST refactoring in JavaSDK that was never tagged as good first issue: https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-sdk-java/issues/431) after some repositories quickly exhausted their known list of good first issues. Dan Widdis, a maintainer of the Java SDK who normally works with a small team, says that "just having a fresh set of eyes and someone to collaborate with led to substantially more robust code than I would have written on my own."
    
3. **Significantly expanded roadmap and capacity.** By having a larger community ready and willing to tackle low-complexity work, maintainers have more time to focus on more complex or high-impact initiatives. The CCI enabled the teams to run several large modernization and tech debt projects in parallel that were not planned until third quarter (Q3) 2023, such as JavaScript to TypeScript migrations (for example [PR#3629](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/3629)), upgrading or removing outdated dependencies (for example [PR#3770](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/3770)), and filling missing documentation gaps (for example [PR#3685](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/3685)). In more challenging projects, such as opensearch-sdk-java, a college contributor completed a hefty task, simplifying refactoring to reduce technical debt of how REST requests were handled (see [SDK PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-sdk-java/pull/643), and [OpenSearch counterpart PR](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/pull/6826)). Completing these and similar tasks prevents future bugs, reduce security vulnerabilities, and cuts down time to fix minor issues. 
4. **Educated the team on working in the open and being open-source maintainers.** Project maintainers gained valuable experience for professional growth in delegating and defining tasks, guiding and improving work, and having sufficient time to think about technical design and architecture while reviewing the implementation of more junior developers. For example, in OpenSearch Dashboards, rather than doing TypeScript and jQuery or Lodash conversions themselves, maintainers instead provided guidance and structure for the contributors to implement those conversions, freeing up time for maintainers to instead focus more on why such migrations are necessary and what the desired outcome looks like ([GitHub issue #3658](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/3658)). One good example comes from an OpenSearch Dashboards developer working with CCI contributors to fix table visualizations bugs. Instead of the maintainer fixing, the maintainer guided the CCI contributors to do it while focusing on the higher-value task of refactoring ([GitHub issue #3737](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/3737), [GitHub issue #3756](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/3756)). This and similar interactions constitute positive promotional feedback for engineers working for Amazon and expand their scope of influence beyond their own team.
5. **Clarified issues and roadmap.** To work with a large number of contributors who are unfamiliar with the OpenSearch Project, maintainers improved their ability to create clearer, more actionable issues. This improvement streamlines tasks for all stakeholders, including leadership and end users, to better keep track of active work and that work's impact. Further, some college contributors have the ability to handle complexity or ambiguity. The maintainers are **leveraging contributors** to help break down issues into smaller subtasks or **complete research tasks** to identify the implementation path (for example, a student [helped benchmark and compare different approaches for converting ML models](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py-ml/issues/123)).
6. **Grown and scaled the community engagement.** Prior to CCI, activity on the forums was minimal, mostly consisting of communications with known partners. With CCI, the forums saw a burst in activity from contributors helping each other out, and from mentors actively engaging. **Forum posts per month have increased over 40%** since the program, and **replies to posts per month have increased over 85%**. For example, [Alexei Karikov](https://forum.opensearch.org/u/orbulon/summary) joined the OpenSearch forum on Mar 1, and immediately began helping other contributors onboard to the program and overcome their technical challenges. In just two months, he is already **#4 in the** [**Forum’s Global leaderboard**](https://forum.opensearch.org/leaderboard)**,** which includes posts, accepted solutions, and likes. Some repositories that had no prior external engagement saw significant activity. For example, in OpenSearch-Dashboards only 1 pull request came from an external contributor in v2.6.0, jumping to **17 merged pull requests in v2.7.0**. In the opensearch-js client repository, the most recent release had **95% contributions** from student contributors, whereas the previous release had only 2.
