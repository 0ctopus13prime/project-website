  description: "Today is a really good day. Since January, we’ve been working together to build OpenSearch 1.0, and today we’re ecstatic to make our first general availability (GA) release. General availability is a huge milestone for the OpenSearch community because it means that OpenSearch is officially production-ready. We’re so proud to share what our passionate and diverse community has built with the world."

Today is a really good day. Since the OpenSearch project started, the goal has been to make OpenSearch ready for production traffic. After a ton of work by the OpenSearch community, we’re thrilled to announce the first general availability (GA) release of OpenSearch 1.0.0. Everyone involved in this passionate and diverse community should be proud of the accomplishment in reaching the GA milestone.

This GA release is the culmination of several stages of development. When the Alpha was released, the [forking team recapped the entire process to that point](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/preparing-opensearch-and-opensearch-dashboards-for-release/5567).  Since then the pace of change on OpenSearch has continued, with the addition of the plugins sourced from Open Distro for Elasticsearch as well as key updates provided by the community.  These updates include:

1. **Continual removal of proprietary code and marks.** While the initial pre-Alpha effort removed the vast majority of the now redundant proprietary bits, additional pieces were removed throughout the rest of development. You should now feel confident that OpenSearch has shed its proprietary cruft.
2. **Migration.** A few people will probably start using OpenSearch 1.0 in a greenfield, but most people will want to migrate into OpenSearch. With this in mind, the team has spent time making this as easy as possible, really no different than a version upgrade in the past, despite being a new, unique piece of software.
3. **Compatibility**. OpenSearch’s usefulness depends on interfacing with a cornucopia of tools and libraries. Each one of these will use OpenSearch slightly differently, so the community has been instrumental in pointing out and helping the developers on the project understand what’s needed to ensure continued compatibility with your favorite tools. This involved making changes to how versions are reported as well as maintaining important markers used by various libraries.
4. **Testing.** With a project as complex as OpenSearch, testing ensures that small changes don’t cascade into unintended problems. As such, the team paid special attention to making sure OpenSearch has a modern and flexible testing infrastructure that will serve the project for years to come. 

The GA version of OpenSearch 1.0 also has a few enhancements:

* Support for the ARM64 architecture for Linux,
* Minimal artifacts for embedding of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards into existing products and services,
* Data stream support for OpenSearch Dashboards,
* Span attribute visibility and filtering in the Trace Analytics plugin,
* Scheduling and tenant support in the Reporting plugin.

You can see all the changes in the [release notes](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-build/blob/main/release-notes/opensearch-release-notes-1.0.0.md).

### **Thank you!**

This release includes a number of great contributions. From the [new plugins](https://opensearch.org/blog/technical-posts/2021/06/my-first-steps-in-opensearch-plugins/) to [improvements to the CX](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/352), you make OpenSearch better every day. So without further ado, a shout-out to everyone who’s contributed to 1.0.0:

### **So what’s next?**

Now that OpenSearch has added test automation, built infrastructure, made updates to ensure the code is suitable for production use, and thoroughly tested, the project will be able to deliver on a more regular release cadence. Exciting things are coming for the project:

* To ensure using OpenSearch is as easy as possible the intention is to release additional artifacts including RPM x64, DEB x64, DEB ARM64, RPM ARM64, MacOS ARM64, MacOS x64, and Windows x64 among others.
* The project will make security **** investments such as more granular security for Index State Management and increasing SAML attribute flexibility.
* Observability features like bucket level alerting and out of the box security and operational analytics experiences will be added to make it easier to analyze your application and infrastructure data.
* OpenSearch will support [cross cluster replication](https://github.com/opensearch-project/cross-cluster-replication/issues/1) to allow you to deploy for higher availability. 
* To help you better understand your data, ML features such as [FAISS](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN/issues/225) library integrations and root cause analysis support will be added. 

...among many others on the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1). 

The next major milestone for OpenSearch is 1.1 and is expected to be released August 30. In addition to more artifact coverage (e.g. RPM X64, DEB X64, DEB ARM64), OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards 1.1 will include improvements to anomaly detection (ex. [universal flow](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/anomaly-detection/issues/380)), [indexing pressure protection](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/478), and [notification support](https://github.com/opensearch-project/notifications/issues/181) among others. Check out the [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opensearch-project/projects/1) for more details.

### **How can you help?**

For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue ([OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues), [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues)). Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you’re trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it’s truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step – but when in doubt, open an issue. If you’re excited to jump in, check out the ["help wanted"](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) tag in issues.

**Questions? Feedback?**
Let us know by opening an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues) or posting in the [forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/). There are also biweekly [Community Meetings](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/). The community meetings will include progress updates at every session and include time for Q&A. The next community meeting is on Monday, July 26, 2021 from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Pacific time.
