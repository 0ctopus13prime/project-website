## Special Thanks
We would like to extend a special thanks to the community of partners already contributing to the project! 

**TODO** Add a list of who have contributed as a special thanks.  

## How can you help?
The biggest thing you can do to help is join us! You can install ([OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and start diving in! Feel free to take a look around at what we've been up to, and then head over to look at the open issues. Or you could jump right in and start opening issues or contributing. For more details see [here](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**When in doubt, open an issue**

For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue. Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you're trying to solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. If it's truly a trivial change (e.g. spelling error), you can skip this step -- but as the subject says, when it doubt, open an issue. 

**Look for the tag "help wanted"**

If you're excited to jump in, we've marked a few issues that would be really helpful (["Help Wanted"](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)).

**Questions? Feedback?**

Let us know in the [forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/). We are also having biweekly [Community Meetings](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/). The community meetings will include progress updates at every session as well as leaving time for Q&A. The next community meeting is on **UPDATE May X, 2021 at X:XX AM Pacific Time (UTC -8) UPDATE**.
