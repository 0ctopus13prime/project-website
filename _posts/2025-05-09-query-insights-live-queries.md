---

OpenSearch Query Insights has become an important tool for understanding search query performance, offering visibility into how queries execute and consume cluster resources. Building on our commitment to help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your search operations, we're excited to introduce a powerful new capability in OpenSearch 3.0: **Live Queries**.

While historical analysis of top N queries helps in understanding trends and past issues, there are times when you need to see exactly what's happening *right now*. Is a particular query taking too long? Is a sudden surge in resource consumption linked to specific search activity? The Live Queries feature provides this immediate insight, allowing you to look into the present state of your cluster's search workload.

## What are Live Queries?

**Introduced in OpenSearch 3.0**, the Live Queries API allows you to retrieve a list of search queries that are currently running across your cluster or on specific nodes. This feature provides real-time visibility, which is invaluable for:

*   **Identifying problematic queries:** Quickly spot queries that are running for an unexpectedly long time.
*   **Debugging resource hogs:** Pinpoint searches consuming significant CPU or memory *at this very moment*.
*   **Understanding immediate cluster load:** Get a snapshot of current search activity impacting your cluster.

The API returns details for each live query, including its source, search type, the indexes involved, the node ID it's running on, its start time, current latency, and resource usage (on the coordinator node) up to that point.

## How Live Queries Work

You can access live query information through a simple REST API endpoint:

```json
GET /_insights/live_queries
```

By default, the API returns a list of currently executing search queries, sorted by `latency` in descending order.

### Key Information Returned

For each live query, you'll receive a rich set of data:

*   `timestamp`: The time the query task started (milliseconds since epoch).
*   `id`: The unique search task ID.
*   `description`: Details about the query, including target indexes, search type, and the query source itself (if `verbose` is true).
*   `node_id`: The coordinator node ID where the query task is running.
*   `measurements`: An object containing performance metrics gathered so far:
    *   `latency`: Current running time in nanoseconds.
    *   `cpu`: CPU time consumed so far in nanoseconds.
    *   `memory`: Heap memory used so far in bytes.

## Getting Started with Live Queries

Interacting with the Live Queries API is straightforward.

### Basic Request

To get a list of currently running queries, sorted by latency:

```json
GET /_insights/live_queries
```

### Customizing Your View with Query Parameters

You can tailor the output using several optional query parameters:

| Parameter | Data type | Description                                                                                                |
| :-------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `verbose` | Boolean   | Whether to include detailed query information (like the query source) in the output. Default is `true`.    |
| `nodeId`  | String    | A comma-separated list of node IDs to filter results. If omitted, queries from all nodes are returned.     |
| `sort`    | String    | The metric to sort results by. Valid values: `latency`, `cpu`, or `memory`. Default is `latency`.          |
| `size`    | Integer   | The number of query records to return. Default is 100.                                                     |

### Example: Finding CPU-Intensive Live Queries

Let's say you want to find the top 5 queries currently consuming the most CPU, without the full query body in the description:

```json
GET /_insights/live_queries?verbose=false&sort=cpu&size=5
```
{% include copy-curl.html %}

### Understanding the Response

Hereâ€™s an example of what the response might look like (showing one query for brevity, based on the documentation example):

```json
{
  "live_queries" : [
    {
      "timestamp" : 1745359226777,
      "id" : "troGHNGUShqDj3wK_K5ZIw:512",
      "description" : "indices[my-index-*], search_type[QUERY_THEN_FETCH], source[{\"size\":20,\"query\":{\"term\":{\"user.id\":{\"value\":\"userId\",\"boost\":1.0}}}}]",
      "node_id" : "troGHNGUShqDj3wK_K5ZIw",
      "measurements" : {
        "latency" : {
          "number" : 13959364458,
          "count" : 1,
          "aggregationType" : "NONE"
        },
        "memory" : {
          "number" : 3104,
          "count" : 1,
          "aggregationType" : "NONE"
        },
        "cpu" : {
          "number" : 405000,
          "count" : 1,
          "aggregationType" : "NONE"
        }
      }
    }
    // ... other live queries
  ]
}
```

From this response, you can see:
*   The query started at timestamp `1745359226777`.
*   It's running on node `troGHNGUShqDj3wK_K5ZIw`.
*   So far, it has been running for over 13.9 seconds (`latency.number` in nanoseconds).
*   It has consumed `405000` nanoseconds of CPU time and `3104` bytes of memory.
*   The `description` (if `verbose=true`) shows the query targets `my-index-*` and includes the actual query structure.

## Why Live Queries Matter

The ability to monitor live queries offers significant advantages:

*   **Immediate Troubleshooting:** When users report slowness, or dashboards indicate high load, Live Queries provide an instant view of active searches. This allows you to quickly identify if a specific query or a pattern of queries is the culprit.
*   **Proactive Performance Management:** By occasionally checking live queries, especially during peak times, you can spot potentially problematic queries before they cause widespread issues.
*   **Resource Consumption Insights:** Understanding which live queries are consuming the most CPU or memory helps in real-time resource assessment and can guide immediate actions, like cancelling a runaway query if necessary (though cancellation itself is a separate OpenSearch Task Management API feature).

## Conclusion

The new Live Queries feature in OpenSearch Query Insights 3.0 adds a critical dimension to query performance monitoring by providing real-time visibility into your cluster's current search workload. This empowers you to diagnose and address performance issues more rapidly, ensuring a smoother and more efficient search experience for your users.

Combined with the existing capabilities of Query Insights, such as top N query analysis and historical data export, Live Queries offer a comprehensive toolkit for managing and optimizing your OpenSearch environment.
