question: Do Elasticsearch clients like Logstash and Beats work with OpenSearch?
category: General
ref: q1.10
---
Since OpenSearch is wire-compatible with Elasticsearch 7.10, any clients that currently work with Elasticsearch 7.10 should also work with OpenSearch, including versions 6.8 through 7.10 of open source Logstash and Beats. Please report any issues you experience with these clients or other clients in our project [GitHub issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues).
