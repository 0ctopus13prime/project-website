‘Open’ and ‘Search’ are two very common words, especially in computing. It’s no surprise that there have been multiple projects that connect these terms. The trademark for OpenSearch is held by Amazon.

## OpenSearch Standard

OpenSearch has a long history at Amazon. At the 2005 O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference, Jeff Bezos showed the world the OpenSearch standard. This standard was born out of A9, the search arm of [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), and allowed for the syndication of search results across services. This standard has lived on and is still valid today. You can find more details on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch). This standard is currently being maintained in GitHub by an ex-A9 employee, at [github.com/dewitt/opensearch](http://github.com/dewitt/opensearch).


## Open Search Foundation

The Open Search Foundation is a European organization that is committed to laying “the ground for an open and free Internet search in Europe and beyond.” You can find the Open Search Foundation at [opensearchfoundation.org.](https://opensearchfoundation.org/)
