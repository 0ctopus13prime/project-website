| Search    |     |
| --------- | --- |
| Visual search | Create applications that allow users to take a photograph and search for similar images without having to manually tag images. |
| Semantic search | Enhance search relevancy by powering vector search with text embedding models that capture semantic meaning and use hybrid scoring to blend term frequency models (BM25) for improved results. |
| Multimodal search | Use state-of-the-art models that can fuse and encode text, image, and audio inputs to generate more accurate digital fingerprints of rich media and enable more relevant search and insights. |
| Generative AI agents | Build intelligent agents with the power of generative AI while minimizing [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)#:~:text=AI%20hallucination%20gained%20prominence%20around,falsehoods%20within%20their%20generated%20content.){:target="_blank"} by using OpenSearch to power retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflows . (Whether you refer to them as chatbots, automated conversation entities, question answering bots, or something else, OpenSearchâ€™s vector database functionality can help them deliver better results). |


| Personalization |     |
| --------------- | --- |
| Recommendation engine | Generate product and user embeddings using collaborative filtering techniques and use OpenSearch to power your recommendation engine.
| User-level content targeting | Personalize web pages by using OpenSearch to retrieve content ranked by user propensities using embeddings trained on user interactions. |

| Data Quality |     |
| ------------ | --- |
| Automate pattern matching and de-duplication | Use similarity search for automating pattern matching and duplicates in data to facilitate data quality processes.

| Vector database engine |     |
| ---------------------- | --- |
| Data and machine learning platforms | Build your platform with an integrated, Apache 2.0-licensed vector database that provides a reliable and scalable solution to operationalize embeddings and power vector search.
